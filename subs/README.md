# How do I get the `jupyter notebooks` to google collab?!?

1. Got to [Github](https://github.com/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/subs)  
2. Go to one of the notebooks. Ie [Group1](https://github.com/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/group1.ipynb)
3. Replace "github.com" in your url with "collab.google" ie [Group1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/blob/master/hamm/blank_hamm-Copy1.ipynb)
