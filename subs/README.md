# How do I get the `jupyter notebooks` to google colab?!?

1. Got to [Github](https://github.com/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/subs)  
2. Go to one of the notebooks. Ie [Group1](https://github.com/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/group1.ipynb)
3. Replace "github.com" in your url with "colab.research.google.com/github/" ie [Group1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hutch-gwc/Rosalind/blob/master/subs/group1.ipynb)
